            <h3>Fried Chicken</h3>
            <p>
                Why are you so <b>obsessed</b> with food? You know this class is right before <b>lunch</b>, right? At least for me. Are you trying to make me hungry? I like the crunch and the texture of fried chicken, with the proper spice pallet, it is one of the best dishes in the world.
                But get off the food kick, I'm hungry.

            <h3>A table. With no chicken. Is a poor table indeed</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>We need to set our table for supper, so that we may eat chicken.</li>
                <li>First, clear any items from the table.</li>
                <li>Then set out plates.</li>
                <li>Add the silverware, with forks on the left hand side.</li>
                <li>Then put a cup on the right side of the plates.</li>
                <li>Now, we are ready to have dinner served.</li>
                <li>Chicken not included.</li>
            </ol>
